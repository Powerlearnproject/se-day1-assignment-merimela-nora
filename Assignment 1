Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering  is the systematic application and engineering principles as well as methods and tools
importance: to create software apps that assist in solving issues that are in the world to today.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
programming languages were developed
rise of agile methodologies came into existence
also the use of structured programming

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements- collecting and gathering information as well as documenting
design-creating and developing of the system or software
testing-this is ensuring that the standards are met
deployment-this is the releasing of the software now to the people
maintenance- this is taking into considerations of updates and enhancements as well

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall-sequential approch with designated phases and example is during the requirements pages they assist in gathering.
agile-this is an iterative way ensuring collaboration and flexibility and the example is like starting with design phase all people do one after the other until its done

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
**software developer** responsible for writing the code for the system 
**quality assuarance** responsible for ensuring that the product meets the required needs annd quality standards
**project manager** incharge of the planning,execution and handing over the projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDES- This is where the code is written, debugging and testing and eg. visual studio
VCS- This is to ensure collaboration, tracking changes as well as commiting and example is git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.lack of communication thus changing requirements last minute
2. tight deadlines
3.  technical debt can be experiened
 **strategies**
 use of agile technologies 
 effective communication amongest users to users and users and developers
 
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing- used for testing individual components
intergration-testing interactions between diffrent components
system testing- testing the entirety of the system
acceptace testing- testing in accordance to user requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the crafting of questions to get best answer possible.
it is importance inorder to get the specific answer rather than general answer

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
give me details of the moon
give me a detailed explanation of the moon
the improved one is more specific and consise and this ensures that the ai gives the best detailed explanation about the moon
